# Scientific Calculator README

## Introduction
This Python script implements a scientific calculator capable of performing various mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus calculation, exponentiation, trigonometric functions, logarithms, calculation of Euclidean distance, and calculation of the area of different shapes and polygons.

## Getting Started
To use this calculator, you need to have Python installed on your system. Simply download the script and run it using a Python interpreter.

## Functions
The calculator offers the following functionalities:

1. **Addition**: Perform addition of multiple numbers.
2. **Subtraction**: Perform subtraction of multiple numbers.
3. **Multiplication**: Perform multiplication of multiple numbers.
4. **Division**: Perform division of two numbers.
5. **Modulus**: Calculate the remainder of division between two numbers.
6. **Powers and Exponents**: Calculate the power of a number.
7. **Calculating Roots**: Calculate the roots or 1/nth power of a number.
8. **Factorial**: Calculate the factorial of a number.
9. **Trigonometry**: Calculate trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant, cotangent).
10. **Logarithms**: Calculate logarithmic values.
11. **Euclidean Distance**: Calculate the distance between two points in a 2D plane.
12. **Area**: Calculate the area of various shapes and polygons.

## How to Use
Upon running the script, you will be presented with a menu where you can choose the desired operation by entering the corresponding number (1-12). Follow the prompts to provide inputs for the chosen operation.

## Additional Notes
- The script utilizes the `tqdm` library to display loading bars for a more interactive experience.
- Some functions may have specific requirements or limitations regarding input values, such as non-negative integers for factorial calculation.
